<h2> 19 </h2>
<pre>
Itâ€™s the 19y since I was born,
yet the world still hides from meâ€”
not like the vivid dreams I had as a child,
where rainbows could be touched
and laughter never faded.
A cup of hot chocolate and cinnamon cookies
remind me how life flows with time,
not quite a fairytale,
but not a punishment either.
My mind never stops thinkingâ€”
not out of regret,
but from the weight of uncertainty
dancing at the edge of night.
God has guided me
to witness beautiful things,
yet somehow...
Iâ€™ve always been blind.
