  <h1>19</h1>
  <pre>
It’s the 19y since I was born,
yet the world still hides from me—
not like the vivid dreams I had as a child,
where rainbows could be touched
and laughter never faded.
A cup of hot chocolate and cinnamon cookies
remind me how life flows with time,
not quite a fairytale,
but not a punishment either.
My mind never stops thinking—
not out of regret,
but from the weight of uncertainty
dancing at the edge of night.
God has guided me
to witness beautiful things,
yet somehow...
I’ve always been blind.
